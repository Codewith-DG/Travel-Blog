                <p><strong><span>K</span>anheri Caves</strong> are a set of 109 caves located in Mumbai, Maharashtra.
                    Featuring carvings and rock-cut monuments whose history can be traced as far back as the
                    first century, the Kanheri Caves are nothing short of a marvel. These Caves are situated on
                    a basalt outcrop in the woods of the famous Sanjay Gandhi National Park. Originally part of
                    the island of Salsette in Mumbai, these caves are now part of the modern suburb of Borivali
                    in the city.
                </p>
                <p><em>History of the Kanheri Caves:</em>
                    The Kanheri Caves, Mumbai, have stood strong through the turns of two millennia. The caves
                    were created on an outcrop of basalt on the island of Salsette, also known as Shatshashthi
                    in Mumbai. Located six miles from Thane, these caves were constructed during the 1st century
                    CE and 10th century CE.
                    The caves are believed to have been crafted by Buddhist monks. There are widespread markers
                    of Buddhism and the teachings of the religion in the architecture and carvings of the caves.
                    Having been constructed on a hill with basalt rocks, the Kanheri Caves, Mumbai, derive the
                    origin of their name from the Sanskrit word Krishnagiri which means black mountain.

                    drive to the base of the hill and then climb a set of stone steps that lead to the caves.
                    For those who enjoy trekking, a trail winds around the mountain, which locals often
                    frequent. The trek is difficult and an excellent option for families and friends. As you
                    hike through the lush hillside, you'll be treated to stunning views of the surrounding

                    relaxing and peaceful experience.
                </p>
                <p> <em>History of the Nashik Caves</em>
                    the caves can be traced back up to the 1st century BCE by inscriptions recording donations.
                    Out of the twenty-four caves, two caves are a major attraction - the main cave which is the
                    Chaitya (prayer hall) has a beautiful Stupa; the second one is cave no. 10 which is complete
                    in all structural as well inscriptions. Both the caves have pictures of Buddha over the
                    rocks. The caves are facing eastwards. So it is recommended to visit the caves early morning
                    as in sunlight the beauty of carvings is enhanced.!

                    <p>I'm Dipak Ghige, the guy behind this website. I'm an Maharastrian who's been traveling the world full time for 8 years now.
                        I started this travel blog in 2019 to document my own trips, share my photos, and help others learn how to travel the world and find some really good spots off the beaten path.
                        All of the writing and pictures on this site come from my own personal experience.
                    </p>
